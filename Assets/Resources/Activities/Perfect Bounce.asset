  description: Sit across from each other at the dining room table. Take turns bouncing
    this ping pong ball on the table. You must each bounce the ball on the table
    such that it bounces exactly twice before reaching the edge.Then you must each
    bounce it exactly three times, and so on. If either of you fails to bounce the
    ball the correct number of times, start over at two bounces. If you can both
    manage to bounce the ball four times, you each get a card punch. If you can both
    bounce the ball five times, you each get a second card punch. No talking is allowed
    once this game begins.
