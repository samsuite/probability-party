  description: "Throughout the rest of the night, you are playing a game of Assassin.
    Each player will be assigned another player to assassinate (get Sam to set this
    up). All participants get a bandana which they will attach to the side of their
    body (through a belt loop, ideally). The bandana must be easy to pull away if
    tugged. To assassinate someone, take their bandana. After assassinating, you
    inherit your victim's target. The final remaining player gets two card punches,
    and the second-to-last player gets one card punch. If you have to leave before
    this game is over, let Sam know and he'll tell your assassin to go after your
    target instead.\r\n\r\nOnce everyone knows their targets and has put on their
    bandanas, go back to the waiting room and continue other activities as normal.\r"
