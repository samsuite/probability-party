  description: Each person should grab a piece of printer paper and a marker. Everyone
    stand in a line and tape your paper to the back of the person in front of them.
    Your goal is to all draw the same thing -- one line at a time, the person in
    the back will draw a simple object, animal, etc on the back of the person in
    front of them. That person then tries to imitate the same line on the person
    in front of them, and so on, until the drawing is finished and everyone has drawn
    all lines. It may be convenient for the person in front to tape their paper to
    a wall. If the first & last drawings are even remotely similar, everyone gets
    one card punch. Get a non-participant to judge if you need to.
