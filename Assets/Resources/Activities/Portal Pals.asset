  description: This is an activity for two people. Your goal is to cooperatively
    complete the opening levels of the classic 2007 puzzle game Portal using only
    one controller. Sit on the couch next to each other and hold the controller so
    that you each have one hand on the controller. Each person is responsible for
    the inputs on their side of the controller. If you can complete all levels up
    to and including test chamber 03, both players get one card punch.
