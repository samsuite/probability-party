  description: Find the taped rectangle on the ceiling of the living room, and throw
    this sticky ball up so it sticks there. Players take turns waiting for the ball
    to fall, then catching it and throwing it back up. If you fail to catch the ball,
    or miss the rectangle on the ceiling, you're eliminated. Last player standing
    wins one card punch.
