  description: Get a timer ready for 15 seconds. Take turns pouring water from a
    measuring cup into a glass. You each have 15 seconds to take your turn. If the
    cup overflows on your turn, you're eliminated. Empty the glass and play again
    until one person remains. That person gets a card punch. Also, put a paper towel
    or something under the glass before you do this.
