  description: Split into teams of two and move far enough away from the other teams
    that you won't be distracted by them talking. On the count of three, both say
    a random word. Count down again, and say the word that you think is "between"
    your word and your partner's word. Repeat this until you say the same word. Keep
    track of how many tries this takes -- both players on the team that succeeds
    with the fewest tries gets a card punch.
