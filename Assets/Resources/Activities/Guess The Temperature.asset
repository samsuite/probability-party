  m_Name: Guess The Temperature
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: Split into two teams. One team selects an object or surface in the
    apartment, then the other team guesses what temperature it is in Fahrenheit.
    Switch team roles and repeat. Verify the temperatures using the laser thermometer
    I have in the kitchen. Whichever team guessed closest to the actual temperature
    of their object wins. All players on the winning team get one card punch.
