  description: Your goal is to convince someone (who is not at this party) to text
    you a photo of themselves smiling very wide and creepily like the joker. You
    have five minutes to choose a target and compose a single text asking for this
    photo. When you're all ready, everyone press send at the same time. Whoever gets
    a photo back first gets a card punch. No followup texts are allowed, and you
    cannot explain the circumstances of the game. If the photo you receive is not
    creepy, you are disqualified. If no one receives a photo within ten minutes,
    you all lose.
