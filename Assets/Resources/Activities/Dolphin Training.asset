  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: Choose who wants to go first (this player is the dolphin). The dolphin
    will go into another room while the remaining players think of a series of actions
    the dolphin must perform (for example, take a book off the shelf and then hop
    up and down on one leg). When you're ready, call the dolphin back into the room.
    After this point, the non-dolphin players cannot speak. Instead, cheer when the
    dolphin does something close to their task, and boo when they do something wrong.
    Once they figure it out, rotate and play again until everyone has had a turn
    as the dolphin. Everyone gets one card punch.
