  m_Name: Grab The Penny
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: All players sit around the dining room table. Place a penny at the
    center of the table. All players get a sticky grabby hand. After a countdown,
    players begin whipping their sticky hands at the penny, attempting to pull it
    towards them. Don't take turns; go as fast as you can. If you pull the penny
    all the way to you, you win. Play this twice. The winner of each round gets one
    card punch.
