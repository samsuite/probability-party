  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: Race to solve paper mazes. Write all participants names on the bracket
    sheet. Each match is 1v1, and the winners of the first two rounds are the finalists
    for the third round (single elimination). For the round marked A on the bracket,
    both players get a copy of the maze marked A, and so on. After a countdown, both
    players try to solve their mazes as fast as possible. The winner of the tournament
    gets two card punches, and the losing finalist gets one card punch.
