  m_Name: Best Potato Chip
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: Grab ten potato chips at random from a bag and put them on a plate.
    Then, sit down and mentally choose the best potato chip. On the count of three,
    both point at your chip. Remove your selected chips and try again, repeating
    until you both choose the same chip. If you get the same chip within two tries,
    you both get a card punch. No discussion of what it means for a potato chip to
    be "the best" is allowed before starting.
