  description: Each player take a sheet of printer paper. Fold your paper into crosswise
    sections equal to the total number of players (for example, if you have three
    players, fold the paper into thirds -- all folds should be parallel). Players
    start by drawing the feet of some sort of person or creature, making sure the
    lines of their drawing continue slightly onto the next panel. Pass your paper
    to the left, and draw the legs or torso of this creature without looking at the
    previous panel. Continue until all panels are done, then share all the finished
    creatures with the group. All participants get one card punch.
