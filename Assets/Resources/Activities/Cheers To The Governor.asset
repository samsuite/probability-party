  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: 'This is a drinking game, but feel free to get something non-alcoholic.
    All players sit in a circle. Choose a player to go first -- that player says
    "one," then the person to their left says "two," and so on until you reach 21.
    The player who says 21 is now the Governor. Everyone says "Cheers to the Governor"
    and takes a drink. The Governor adds a new rule for one of the numbers: for example,
    instead of saying "five" clap twice, or instead of saying "seventeen" say "abracadabra."
    If you fail to follow a rule, take a drink and start back at "one." Play until
    you have a rule for every number. All players get a card punch.'
