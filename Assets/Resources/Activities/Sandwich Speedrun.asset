  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: Players compete to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as fast
    as possible. Take turns making your sandwiches. Take as much time as you like
    to get your ingredients ready, but you may not begin sandwich construction until
    the timer starts. A legal sandwich must have an even layer of peanut butter and
    an even layer of jelly between two slices of bread. The fastest sandwich artist
    gets two card punches.
