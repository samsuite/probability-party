Fold your paper into crosswise sections equal to the total number of players (for example, if you have three players, fold the paper into thirds -- all folds should be parallel). Players start by drawing the feet of some sort of person or creature, making sure the lines of their drawing continue slightly onto the next panel. Pass your paper to the left, and draw the legs or torso of this creature without looking at the previous panel. Continue until all panels are done, then share all the finished creatures with the group. All participants get one card punch.",
